    <h3>Family Pizza Time</h3>
    <p>
      What to do when your 8-year-old nephew comes to visit? Make pizza, of
      course!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until we exhausted
      Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn out to be a brilliant idea
      as my father had just received a baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew
      loves pizza.
    </p>
    <p>
      I told him if he helped me make it, I would talk about him on my website,
      and he would be famous. That seemed to get his attention. He thought the
      dough was "slimy and gross," but he loved picking his own toppings, and
      the finished product was "awesome".
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F)</li>
      <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking pizza in a
        wood-fired pizza oven)
      </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps on: How to Make Pizza</h3>
    <p>
      For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and
      layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the
      run-down:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet)</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into 2 balls</li>
      <li>Prep the toppings</li>
      <li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round</li>
      <li>Brush the dough top with olive oil</li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened dough on top
      </li>
      <li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings</li>
      <li>Slide the pizza into the oven</li>
      <li>Bake</li>
    </ol>
